# React Docker Example
*by Daniel Loddo*

This is a simple example **React** and **Docker** application. Here you will find code and files where I try these technologies.

*More in detail:*
- **Docker**: In this repository there is a Dockerfile to install React using Vite on Node.js version 18.
- **React**: I tried some basic functionalities of React, like application state and components.
